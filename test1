Develop your features and fix bugs in feature branches based off your main branch. These branches are also known as topic branches. Feature branches isolate work in progress from the completed work in the main branch. Git branches are inexpensive to create and maintain. Even small fixes and changes should have their own feature branch.

Creating feature branches for all your changes makes reviewing history simple. Look at the commits made in the branch and look at the pull request that merged the branch.

Name your feature branches by convention
Use a consistent naming convention for your feature branches to identify the work done in the branch. You can also include other information in the branch name, such as who created the branch.

users/username/description
users/username/workitem
bugfix/description
feature/feature-name
feature/feature-area/feature-name.
